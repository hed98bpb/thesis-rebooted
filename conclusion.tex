We have read and understood Hershberger et al. \cite{HershbergerS99} and
Hershberger et al. \cite{HershbergerKS17} and retold them in this thesis
filling in details and drawing some more figures. We also came up with a simple
algorithm for constructing the visibility graph, implementing it and see that
the actual run time was the same as theoratical.
