\chapter{Introduction} Given a starting point $s$, an endpoint $t$ and a set of
polygons $P$, we want to find the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ without
traveling in the interior of any polygon in $P$. It is an old and well studied
problem, and historically there have been two approaches to the problem,
visibility graph and continuous Dijkstra. 

The visibility graph approach is to construct a graph of all legal paths
\nick{What is a legal path} and
then running a single source shortest path algorithm on that graph. The problem
with this approach is that the complexity of the graph can be $\Omega(n^2)$,
where $n$ is the number of vertices of the polygons. \nick{Sounds weird}

The continuous Dijkstra works by simulating a wave front
propagation\nick{define wavefront propagation} from the
start point $s$, where at simulation time $t$ the wavefront contains all the
points that is reached within distance $t$.  Every time a vertex edge is
reached a new wavefront starts emitting from there. In 1999 Hersberger and Suri
held a presentation in which they presented a $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm which
matched the lower bound of the problem, using the continuous Dijkstra method.

In 2017 they, together with Neeraj, looked at a generalization of that problem.
Given the same setting as before, you are now allowed to remove $k$ polygons.
Which polygons should you remove to minimize the distance from $s$ to $t$. They
presented an $O(k^2 n\log n)$ algorithm for this problem, which used a modified
version of the 1999 algorithm. Notice that if $k=0$ its the same problem as the
1999 one.

In this thesis we are going to look into implementations of the generalist
problem. We start by describing and implementing a naive algorithm for solving
the problem based on computing a visibility graph and then running the Dijkstra
single source shortest path algorithm. Afterwards we are going to explain the
implementation details and lastly we describe the algorithm from 2017 and
implement that.

\section{Problem description} 
We a given two points in the plane $s,t\in\mathbb{R}^2$ and a list of polygons
$P=p_1,\dots,p_h$ where $p_i$ is a list of points in polygon $p_i$ starting an
abitrary place and in clockwise order(note that sometimes we use $P$ as a set
f. ex. polygon $p_i\in P$). We say a legal path is a list of points where two
adjecent points are mutually visibible, i.e. you are able to draw a line from
one to the other without crossing the interioer of any polygon in $P$. 
We want to find a shortest legal path from $s$ to $t$.

In 1978 Lee presented a $O(n^2\log n)$ algorithm for constructing a visibility
map in his Ph.d.  thesis\cite{LEE78}, we couldn't find the original paper, the
running time is taken from \cite{HershbergerS99}. 

Seven years later, in 1985, Welzl \cite{DBLP:journals/ipl/Welzl85} published a
$O(n^2)$ time algorithm consuming $O(n^2)$ for construction of a visibility
map.  

Six years later in 1991 Ghosh et al.\ \cite{GhoshM91} presented a $O(E+n\log n)$
algorithm consuming $O(E+n)$ space, for constructing a visibility graph where
$E$ is the number of edges in the visibility graph.
Since the visibility graph can contain $O(n^2)$ the algorithm is output bound
and people started making shortest path map algorithm insteed, hoping to reach
the $\Omega{(n\log n)}$ lower bound (see chapter \ref{chapter:lowerbound}).

That same year in 1991 Michell \cite{DBLP:journals/amai/Mitchell91} published
an algorithm for constructing the shortest path map, with running time
$O(kn\log^2 n)$ and $O(n)$ space consumption. Where $k$ is bounded by the
number of different obstacles that touches any shortest path from $s$.

In 1996 he improved the run time to $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$, for any
$\varepsilon>0$ where the constant in big-Oh notion depends on $\varepsilon$
keeping the linear space consumption  \cite{DBLP:journals/ijcga/Mitchell96}.

Then finally in 1999 Hershberger et al.\ \cite{HershbergerS99} revealed a
$O(n\log n)$ algorithm for computing the shortest path map, matching the lower
bound. The space consumption is $O(n\log n)$ and it is still an open problem if
there exists an algorithm with run time $O(n\log n)$ and linear space
consumption.
