\chapter{Delaunay triangulation}\label{appendix:delaunaykruskal}

To understand what a Delaunay triangulation is, we start by understanding what a 
Voronoi digram is. The Voronoi digram is build around points in a plane, where 
the plane partition into a set of cells, where each cell has exactly one point 
in its interior. The special property for each of these cells is that each edge 
in there border is placed between two points, in such a way that the distance 
from the two points to any point on the edge is the same. The Voronoi digram can 
be computed in $O(n \log n)$ time \cite{CompGeo}. 

Delaunay Triangulation can then be understood as the dual graph of the Voronoi 
diagram. That is, we can build a graph, where the vertex in each cell of the 
Voronoi diagram gets a edge to another vertex if the vertex is a neighboring 
cell. This gives us a triangulation of the all the points in the plane, where
no edge overlaps.
